# OrderBook
**Bid/Ask/Trade Order Book in Python**

## What?

A Python script leveraging the requests package to fetch Bid, Ask and Trade information tick by tick from the open source and free IEC Cloud API.

## Why?

There HAS to be hidden knowledge in the development of the bid / ask prices and ask sizes during the trading day. My goal is to figure that out, and develop an algoritm to trade the market with little risk. Sounds too good to be true? Yes, and it probably is. 

## When?

The script to pull the data and format into neat, tick time indexed, pandas dataframe is ready. Now need to build the code to loop the code, and dump the data in a robust database. Do this for a few months, so I hope, and that should be plenty of data to start working with.

All support welcome!
